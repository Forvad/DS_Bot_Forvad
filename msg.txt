Hi all!
Hiiii
How's it going, any activity on the project?
It's cool! you can look in the announcements section, there will be answers)
Ok, thank u
What about you?
Yes too, just found this project))
Yes, the project is really interesting, worth a look!
I heard that you can get on the whitelist at this point?
Good activity is rewarded with
You can get stuck in a project like this for a day! :)
Ahahahaha, yeah, it's really good :D
The artwork is very beautiful <3
yeah, enough time has been invested))
BTW, thanks for the help)
Always happy to help! :)
you have a very responsive community!
trying)
It's really gratifying!
I, unfortunately, am not so talented to be so supportive :D
Has anyone been active in this project?
)))
Art or video, that's what I mean.
Well, we can't all be Picasso, ahahaha
ahhahahh
Never even tried to draw?
I'm not really talented at that kind of activity either :D
It's hard to predict, but I think it's far from bad)
Also true
Such projects with a good audience are popular!
Nah, that's not mine(
How are you guys?
how do you think cool NFTs will be sold?
My eyes already hurt to sit for Discord :D
Absolutely!
Soon we will have to earn not wl, but the eyesight)))
even to get a white sheet are complex requirements
Studying
this is usually a good indicator for the project
Programming faculty
Oooh, what beautiful weather we're having today)
Yes, of course knowledge helps
How's the weather with you guys?
What do you do?
I hope it's the same as mine, ahahaha
Guys, let's push the chat, raise the activity ;)
Mine is cool
I'm from Russia. And you?
ahahhaha ++ 
Ahhaha, go
Are you studying or working?
I seriously think this project deserves a 10!!!
Yeah, and who?
Yeah, I just took another look at the art
Cool
I can safely give it a 10
Just in the field of crypto is in demand))
It depends on what, haha)
I just finished training
Well, I don't really like it
For an economist
I can play in the company of friends
Let's do it!
stopped playing computer games
where r u from?
I've played ps four times in my life
Me too)
I probably don't play because I'm not very good at it))))
Guys
Why do you ask?
Let's start a flash mob
A fan of the game?)
Rate the project in chat from 1 to 10
Agreed
Yeah, I think so, too)))
Especially for the younger generation
Any players here?)
Well yes, crypto now opens up great opportunities for everyone
Well, I meant computer games / ps
yep
So about the players :)
Yeah, for about a year)
Well, no, I just recently discovered p2e for myself
And you?
In general, it seems very promising to me
Few :)
Used to just kill time
a newbie yet
And now it's possible to make some extra money)
And what do you think, anyway?
Yep
Like it?
Crypto opens up cool opportunities
Ahahahaha, for real 
Many nfts resell and have 3 monthly salaries
Well, they helped me in the early stages, too
Now is the perfect time to enter this market!
Even here in the chat room guys, sociable
I concur
Yep
By the way
About what?)
How long have you been in crypto?
Oooh, well, that's a tough question)))
Broo
I generally rest in my free time
I said, how long are you in the crypt?
Maybe I'm looking for some projects
I'm about three or four months maybe
By Twitter, Medium
Ahahaha, yeah
Or I'm taking a walk
Well, I'm still figuring it out, to be honest
:)
Not everything is clear
I don't know any funny ones(
But the guys are helping
Well you can look at the trends
Why I liked this project)
That's how I usually pick movies)
You've met)))
But I'm more of an outdoorsman
That's cool
You can go to the park or take the dog for a walk 
Guys
I see, then))
I want to ask this 
Come on, come on)
Now I've some free time
I thought you'd be gone by now
What can you do? :DD
Just started communicating so well)))
Not half bad ideas :) thanks
Ahhhah, go go
I, too, mostly try to spend my free time in a constructive way
Yeah, when you start making friends in a chat, it gets fun
But sometimes you just want to be lazy :DD
I'm not aiming for the wl either
BTW, maybe watch a movie!?
I just want to have a good time, in pleasant company)
Recommend a movie pls
Yeah, guys?)
Oh :(
I'm to music, too
Ahahaha, it's cool to have a dog, but I don't have one)))
Sitting down, scribbling messages
I just live in an apartment
Wonderful! :)
I'll look for the movie then...
Cool, but I don't really have any favorite genres
I looked at the charts
I can listen to anything
I didn't find anything cool)
I often listen to podcasts as well
I'd rather have an asset in the chat room, hahah
You're also developing and doing things in parallel
I'll be useful :DD
I read it too
Aahahahaha, no bro
It's important to evolve, I agree.
Let's rock the chat project)
But I like to learn by doing
In fact, I've already joined the chat
It makes the information easier to digest
I just love spending time here
Well, yes, I agree
You don't even need VL :D
Well, it's not always fun, haha
Let's just have a fun time
Yep, bro!
I completely agree
Speaking of books, what are your favorites?
I'm just sitting here listening to music and chatting
but still there is some favorite topic
It's cool, I like it!
economy only?
What kind of music do you like, by the way?
))) I just wanted to start reading something for a long time and put it into practice
Genre or artists
why? classical literature accompanies us all our lives
I like rock
ahahah, did you like it so much?
Well, that's probably the most
I think you're right, with me at least +++++++
But in general - melomal :D
if you were a writer, you could write a book about this project
I don't really like podcasts, by the way
you already have one fan for sure
More videos of some kind
)))))
Often about cryptocurrency
Do you know what you need first of all to become a writer?
Or I read different chats)
white list of paper)))
Well, in practice it is
yes fantasy and good imagination
But it is not always possible to achieve a good result without theory
Sure? Come on, come up with some chat game to make everyone have fun
How quickly we moved from fun conversations to serious topics :DD
What kind of game is this?
Right)
strange game)
But laughter prolongs life
how's that?
Yeah, guys?)
Aaaaa, now I understand, but is it a long time?
Oh bro, if I start listing my favorite books, then we will stay here for a long time. 
what is the restriction?
Of course,But as I have already said, I am an economist, so I like to read books on economics
good idea
No, of course, I also like the classics.  Why do you ask?"
let's try it
Ahah, classical literature is hard to put into practice
Lucky
Perhaps, but it seems to me that my whole life will now be accompanied by this cool project
Gorgeous
of course this project is cool and I think many will put + if they agree with me. Right?
Again I came across a letter
I would immediately become a popular writer
we need to think about it...
I think there would be thousands and even more
leading
What, bro?
I will answer that you are right and say due
Lol, it's trure. Maybe you need something else?
what are you going to say to me now?
I'm fine with my imagination
haha I also have the letter e. Ok, essential
Game? Let me think....What about the word game?
let's have the last slvo and get some rest guys
I call the word, you call the next word
it was a cool game, you can immediately see that there is a fantasy
I forgot to say, your word should start with the last letter of my word
Yes, I loved playing football and basketball
I say sea, you say air, understand?
My height is like Arnold Schwarzenegger's
yes, so let's make a restriction
I wonder what kind of game I came up with?)))
we will describe this project)))
Yep, a couple of years ago there seemed to be such a challenge
Ok
Yeah, I remember one very popular challenge Ice Bucket Challenge
Then I'll be the first
I remember how I tried to pass it
Cool 
If you could only see it guys
Yong
I was very cold and almost fell
successful
apparently you and I have problems with coordination
hahah
many people like to do challenges because it has many advantages
You decided to take revenge on me
for me the main advantage is that it's fun
And I fell for the letter again g, ok
it also unites you with your loved ones
Gold.What do you say to that?
yes, fun prolongs life. Are you good friends?
I'll say you're smart and I'll answer effective 
you said that right
I agree then I will end this game with a word long-term
When I'm sad I like to spend time with my friends
Yes, I liked to play different games with my friends as a child. I think many people loved it
these people become a part of your life
basketball, you must be tall?
I agree with you this project unites people with different interests
He is tall. here's another game you've come up with
for example at a football match)))
I think a lot of guys have guessed what kind of game it is
I think there are a lot of people here who like to play sports
Okay I'll tell you
and what about you, are you really not interested in sports at all?
this is a game compare your height with the height of a celebrity
after all, sport helps not only physically but also spiritually
have you heard of such a game??
if I'm sad, then I play football or go to the chat of this project))))
Yes, he was popular once
oh it depends on the championship
Hey guys, what challenges do you remember?
In Spain I like Barcelona, In Italy inter, in England tottenham
One of the most popular for me Mannequin Challenge
but my favorite football club is Bayern Munich these guys play great
Maybe there are some other popular and interesting ones?
Ahah many clubs are named after cities, but Tottenham plays for London))
I hope you didn't get sick or hurt yourself
you need to look at the game of these guys, they are very fast
I also tried to pass this challenge
you can also find a lot of friends at the football stadium
But I wasn't too cold and I didn't fall
haha it depends on the match, but believe me, there are rarely quiet matches
But when I was performing a mannequin challenge with friends, I could fall
I went to football matches where it was very loud
I still apparently we like to perform challenges)))
at first I also behaved quietly, but then I joined the team)))
I agree with you, it also helps you find new acquaintances
I can say one thing at a football match you feel free
if you remember my first challenge, which I forgot the name of
I used to be very shy too and rarely talked in a big company
then thanks to it I found myself 2 new friends
but after I started communicating more on the internet, everything changed
I think a lot of people find new friends when they have fun
I began to know more, I made more friends
Yeah, we have been friends for 5 years
in fact, even virtual communication helps real
I think my life would be boring without them
if you learn to communicate on the Internet, then you will be able to communicate in real life.
friends can always help you in a difficult moment of life
what is the topic?
That's right man that's right
Hah, you are right
that's why people create such projects
imagine how people lived before the Internet
as we have already said, this is not just a project, it is a community for friendship
they couldn't communicate with each other just sitting at the computer
and really where else will a programmer and an economist meet?
do you have a programmer friend?
I remember I remember you're a football player and a basketball player
hahah, yes, at first it is very difficult to understand this
I wonder what kind of sport the other guys are doing in this chat?
Even for me, programming was hard at first
maybe someone likes to play chess or boxing?
the crypto world is developing rapidly and they don't teach this at the university
I used to like to play table tennis,but then there was little time
therefore, the skills of a programmer help, but it's still very hard at first
As a child, I wanted to become an adult and now I understand that I want to become a child again
Hah, each person is different, but the profession is postponed in the head
I think childhood is the best years for many
many people think that programmers should wear glasses and have long hair
by the way, did you say which team you support
but these are all stereotypes modern programmers can be different
ah for me it's like the names of cities
I have a friend who loves boxing and at the same time he has excellent eyesight and yes he is a programmer
sunny Barcelona, foggy Tottenham
are you kidding? of course, look at how many topics we have
I love new friends, but I think there are too many people at the stadium and I can't hear anything
we have already managed to talk about sports, programming and literature
However, I have not been to a football stadium to draw such conclusions
Of course I don't forget I just didn't finish writing
maybe all the quiet guys are there?))
in this chat everyone loves to communicate so much that you don't have time to express your thoughts
it would be cool to go to some sporting event
once again I am convinced that the project is good and active
I think it will help me feel more at ease
Wait, are you by any chance hinting at me
It's just that when there are a lot of people I get shy
Of course I don't mind you're a cool guy judging by the correspondence
this is exactly what such projects exist for
And in general I see a lot of interesting people here
at least we all have one common topic
it's cool that so many people are interested in this project
It is this amazing project 
we can help each other and develop together here
You sound like my programmer friend.
I don't know about the cooks, but the programmers definitely have to send you a picture of a donut?
Yeah
yes, you won't be able to taste it, but you will definitely be able to enjoy its beauty
we have been friends with him for about 3 years
welcome to the world of NFT
It was he who told me about NFT and the crypto world
here a picture can not only feed you but also help you buy a car
At that moment I thought he was speaking a different language
if, of course, you choose the right projects, for example, like this one
and again you sound like my programmer friend, are you all so similar?
I wonder how long the other guys have been involved in this project?
I agree, every person is different
many do not have time to read my message and it goes away
but you can always find a common topic for conversation even if you are different
I hope at least someone has time to read my suggestions
do not forget about friends and about the crypto world, including this project
I didn't doubt you bro
I forgot to say that my programmer friend also loves football
previously, people could not even think that it was possible to be friends at a distance
and he was also modest at first
at the same time, just sitting at home and chatting in discord
That's right bro you're my friend now if you don't mind
I imagine if my parents decided to participate in this project))))
yes, you've got that right
it can be said that they have a little knowledge in this area
they ask a lot of questions here, but you can get an answer to everything
but at the same time they don't understand what I'm doing here
I like that it concerns not only this project but also any issue
in their opinion, I'm just sitting in the computer and typing something on a dark screen :)))
it seems that if I ask for a recipe for delicious donuts, there will definitely be a cook here
we have to explain to them what crypto is
are there cooks here, guys?
once it was difficult for us to walk, but now we walk
hahahah no thanks
I believe that if a person has a desire, then he can do everything
I think the picture is unlikely to be able to feed me
Elon Musk was able to found such a large number of companies
Hahahahahahahhah,you've got that right, right to the point
at the same time, Elon Musk is the same person as us
Don't forget about me bro, I always see your messages
he's just very hardworking and believes in his ideas
are your parents interested in crypto?
to the point bro to the point
Do you think you can?
the modern world requires rapid adaptation
this is very difficult for the previous generation
yes i also made a lot of friends in the nft world
hard work always gives results
I think a lot of guys here are practicing their English
even if we take the founders of this project, these guys are cool
because this project is popular all over the world
many people do not even want to understand a little about the modern world
Who ever dreams of moving to another country and staying there to live?
and these guys from 0 created such a project around which a cool community gathers
Yes, he was born in Africa
I watch you love motivational videos)))
while still in this country, he became interested in programming when his father bought him a computer
probably many guys here are very motivated
now he owns many large companies
personally, this project motivates me to develop
oh I would have my own company or create my own nft project:)))
at least I'm learning English here
80 hours a week? when do they have time to rest?
And of course I make a lot of new friends talking here
Why?
I would like to move to america or england
you're right, I noticed it myself
there are many interesting people and opportunities in these countries
I have tried many professions in my life
even if we remember Elon Musk, he is also not from America
and it is programming and the computer world that are of interest to me
It seems that he was born in Africa and then moved to America
I hope I can achieve good results in this
:D many want to be company owners
of course they love this project
but it's really hard
i already read a lot of posts from guys here
many rich and successful people work 80 hours a week
everyone is sure that this is not just a cool, but also an amazing project
they don't need rest as much as we do
Yes, I agree with you, many people are waiting here for a mint, and I just want to be part of this project
one of the factors of proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle
oh, now it's hard to remember when was the last time i did it
but most importantly, they do what they like
for a long time i had bad weather and didn't go outside
some like to build rockets, some like to sing, some like to dance
only a couple of days ago it got warmer and I can at least go out for a walk
and when you really do what you love, you get a good result
really I don't want to go out for a walk now, I want to chat in this chat
it's just that many people are accustomed to work because they have to, and not because they want to
I try to plan my day, but it doesn't always work out.
of course you can:DDD
Plus, the specifics of my work involves a home lifestyle
We are already participating in such a cool project
You can say that this is why I started to get involved in football and basketball.
and i'm sure a lot of guys here like to be a part of it
To unload yourself a little and lead an active lifestyle
right guys, do you like this project?
Yes, guys, don't forget to exercise, it's very good for your health.
in fact, there are a very large number of different projects
This is how the world works and marketing is aimed at this.
you need to know which ones are good.
I read somewhere that the most needed goods are usually located at the end of the store so that a person walks through the entire store
for example, this project may be one of the very promising
maybe something on his way will attract his attention and he will buy it
By the way, how long have you been playing football or basketball?
Bro, I used to think that economics is something boring, where only numbers and graphs are studied))))
Look, do not get carried away so much, we have already talked about a healthy lifestyle
But now I understand that the economy is very interesting
Many people lead a healthy lifestyle
now it doesnÂt seem to me that all economists are strict and serious men
Therefore, you need to properly plan your day in order to have time to do as much as possible.
Maybe I should become an economist too?
For example, I wake up somewhere at 8-9 o'clock in the morning and go to breakfast
It is quite possible, this is one of the most developing areas
after that I read 30 minutes of a book, then I get down to some work
Many of my friends are gradually becoming interested in the crypto world
but communication here is not work for me, here I rest
Of course, not without my help, because I really like to discuss this topic)))))
And don't forget to read books, it's good for your brain))))
Yes, creativity is what drives us forward.
It seems so easy to lead a healthy lifestyle, but when there are so many temptations around, it becomes hard
I think that in a few decades we will not be able to keep up with this world
in all stores there is a lot of junk food, which is located in the most prominent place
space travel for ordinary people is now becoming something common
So people can't help but buy something harmful
And you wonÂt surprise anyone with the Internet in the middle of the desert, although earlier even in the city center you could be without the Internet
as a future economist, I will say that you are absolutely right
You didn't say you have a brother even though we didn't talk much about our families, so I'll tell you first.
marketing is a whole art that consists of many parts
I have an ugly sister who is 30 years old and a younger brother who is 10 years old.
marketing is advertising and transportation and much more
I will keep the age of my parents a secret, but they say that they are very young)))))
even the arrangement of goods on the shelves, it's all marketing
Hahah, but it seems to me that many parents want to have grandchildren already.
Hahah, you can try, but everything has its downsides
They love to spend time with children and they have fun with them.
the main thing is to be open to new knowledge and new skills
When my sister brings her children to the parents, everyone is very happy
who would have thought for a couple of decades that the Internet would be in almost every house and all people would be able to communicate with each other
I also have childhood one of the most favorite moments in my life
Now the world is developing at a very fast pace and a lot is moving into crypto.
loved to spend time with his friends
I believe that the cryptocurrency of the future of the whole world
but unfortunately today's youth do not really like to develop on the Internet
In general, bro, I noticed that you are a very interesting person and you can talk on many topics, from sports to cryptocurrency
they have no idea how limitless the information here can be
I like it when people don't get hung up on one thing and are interested in many things in this world
By the way, why did you decide to become an economist?
these are the people who move our generation and create progress on the planet
this is a very difficult profession that requires skills in mathematics and other sciences
If we were all afraid of something new, we would still walk with sticks and stones
then I will tell you why I decided to become a programmer
you probably noticed it, even my younger brother, who is now 6 years old, actively uses the Internet
I like the freedom of action that this profession gives you
On the one hand, it's good that he learns something new.
you can work from anywhere in the world and choose a schedule that suits you
but at the same time, he can also learn negative information, so my parents sometimes restrict his access to the Internet
I agree, I thought a lot depends on where you study, but then I realized that this is not so
Hahah, I think all parents say they are very young
hahahahaha yes now you can become a professional no matter where you were born
I also have an older sister and she is an economist in good company.
many professionals are now working remotely from their homes and from their country
we also have a dog and a cat, they are very dear to us, so we consider them part of our family
even if you take our chat, there are people from almost all countries of the world
parents also often ask me about grandchildren, but I donÂt want to have children yet, too early)))))
Yes, why are you asking?
Yes, childhood is a very happy moment in the life of many people.
Oh, this list is going to be very long.
I remember how I loved to eat sweets and walk around the amusement park with my parents.
I like to watch horror, thrillers, comedies, sometimes I like to watch cartoons
At that moment, even the smallest carousel seemed like a huge attraction.
If we talk about specific films, I can highlight the Shawshank Escape and the Green Mile
Eh, now even rollercoasters get boring sometimes
Hahahaha I like the superhero movie genre too
Yes, the Internet opens up endless possibilities for us.
especially the avengers movie it was something
but real life is also very important
I wanted to stand up and start applauding in the hall
many of my friends rarely go out and prefer to spend time alone
they have been preparing this for us for 10 years to unite all the heroes
sometimes because of this I feel lonely and lack communication
Therefore, he is one of the main characters that he was able to sacrifice himself to save the rest.
but thanks to such projects I find new friends and can communicate with them
In general, this genre is now gaining momentum.
I just like to work with numbers and understand how our world works.
I wonÂt be surprised if NFT projects about superheroes become popular soon
Many people think that being an economist is boring, but it's fun enough.
big goals are always achieved through perseverance
We study in the classroom not only individual enterprises but also entire states
If you believe in yourself, then you can try
Yes, free schedule is cool
who knows, maybe your project will become very popular))))
as they say, you need to work not 24 hours, but with your head
All this is solved simply, little experience - train, you need a team - make new friends here
there are a lot of promising professions that are not taught at the university
Do you think everyone is born at once geniuses and know what they will do?
Much depends on the desire of the person and no matter where you study
you have to do what you believe and what you want
Often graduates of very good universities cannot find a good job because they rely only on the university
Watch the founder's film about how McDonald's was built and how many obstacles the main character had
and ordinary guys from ordinary universities achieve huge success
I'm not such a fan of series because they last too long
what can I say, some only graduate from school and begin to realize themselves
another thing movies 2-3 hours and you are free
do you like watching movies?
Oh, about the villains, you probably noticed often they just become rejected by society
I wanted to know what genres do you like and what movies do you like
Heroes are another matter, society is always kind to them and rejoices at the appearance of
you can say that you love almost all genres))))
Yes, time is a very limited resource. Recently, I donÂt even have time to watch movies.
I also like to watch comedies but I also like horror
I have already started watching movie reviews to save my time.
A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of my favorite movies.
there are so many movies now and you donÂt even know what to choose)))
I also like superhero movies
Do you have a girlfriend? You are lucky)))
Yes, it was very cool
It's just cool when someone is next to you and loves you, with whom you can spend your free time
my friends and I were in complete awe, but we felt sorry for the iron man
I don't get it with girls I don't know why
he is one of the main characters and sacrificed his life
It seems that I'm a nice guy and I communicate well, but for some reason I can't communicate with girls easily
I already heard about the idea of ??such projects
Sometimes I feel like I've been cursed for this topic
it would be very cool to come up with your own project and implement it, but it is very difficult
Yes, but at least you were friends with her, and I'm not even good at making friends.
Ahahah thank you for believing in me but there are a couple of problems
I don't know why so maybe I have little experience, but I'm working on this problem
Firstly, I have very little experience in this area.
I'm not worried)))) I always have time
Secondly, I think that it is very difficult and you cannot do without a good team.
now I just want to realize myself and succeed, then direct my efforts to building relationships
Third, there is a lot of competition here.
Yes, I have time to rest, itÂs just that mench have a different rest
I saw this movie and it really motivated me
Now it's getting warmer outside and I want to start playing basketball and football again
I was also very motivated by the series Silicon Valley
both useful and fun
how an ordinary guy was almost able to start his own company, but in the end he realized something
Ahah, many people like interesting communication and not muscles
I won't say otherwise it's not interesting to watch)))))
communication with girls is at a low level
I like series because they give a lot of time to develop characters.
but only sports will not interest them
you have time to begin to empathize with the characters and understand their tragic fate
This is exactly what I've been doing lately.
sometimes even the villain turns out to be simply hostages of circumstances and society does not understand them
and I noticed that there is some progress
I'm not sure if the characters would look the same in real life.
it becomes easier for me to communicate, but so far there are some difficulties
there is a series boys which shows how heroes can deceive
:)))))))))), I think so
In general, I really like to watch series, but they really take a lot of time.
oh how many topics we have already discussed with you, we just became good friends
You are right on target
I will say hello to new members and those who have been here for a long time
My girlfriend and I choose what to watch every evening and spend a lot of time on it.
Hi guys
I sometimes feel like choosing a movie takes more time than watching a movie.
how do you formally address, as if we are in some serious organization
Sometimes it even becomes too lazy to choose something and we again watch films that we have already seen several times
By the way, where do you like to go?
yes, we have known each other for many years but started dating a year ago
I like visiting friends
why do you think i'm lucky?
so good atmosphere and calm atmosphere
Whoa bro, don't talk like that, you're a cool guy
I don't like going to places where there are a lot of people
It just takes time to find a good girl who appreciates you.
I also noticed that the weather turned bad, maybe there are reasons
I also spent a lot of time to find my girlfriend))))))
Have you heard anything about global warming?
don't worry, you will definitely find a girl, it just takes time
I recently watched a program on TV where they talked about the possible consequences of global warming.
That's commendable bro, but you need to start soon
they said that even a few degrees of warming could lead to difficult consequences
itÂs just that many, in pursuit of success, do not have time to live and enjoy life, then it becomes too late
Let's try to put our knowledge into practice?
Yes, I agree that working hard is good, but rest is also necessary.
For example, I am a programmer and I can develop some programs aimed at solving this problem.
scientists have proven that after proper rest you become more productive
I can come up with a program that will measure the temperature of the entire planet and offer certain solutions to this problem
Here's an argument for you to find a girl))) they like athletes))))
You see, we can already apply our knowledge in practice))))
bro, you motivated me so much and now you are depressed
True, these are only ideas so far and it is very difficult to implement them.
it starts to seem to me that this is your weak point and you are worried about it
but as someone said, thoughts are material))))))
try to just practice a lot and make new acquaintances with girls
Something we began to discuss serious topics, I propose to relax a bit and talk about food))))
Now I see some optimism.
who has a favorite food?
the main thing to remember is that thoughts come true
I like healthy food so I like to eat fruits and vegetables
before, I also did not believe that thoughts can be realized, but then I realized how it works
It's you in vain bro, they are very useful and they have a lot of vitamins
your thoughts affect your perception of this world that's how it works
especially in berries, this can be said to be a treasure trove with vitamins
then I'll say hello
it's good when you have your own house and you can grow vegetables and fruits
hello boys and girls
but unfortunately I live in an apartment, so I buy vegetables and fruits
I didn't forget, I just like to say hello like that
Ahah, I would love to, but first they need to be planted in the soil
I like going to the cinema and cafes, and you?
and it will take a long time for the harvest
oh, if the weather were nice now, I would go for a walk outside
you immediately come to the store and buy, but homemade food is of course healthier
I don't like it when it's raining and foggy outside
My grandparents also live in the countryside.
the weather has been bad lately
and they also have a very large garden, but unfortunately they are far from me
What do you mean?
sometimes I really miss them
Yes, a lot of people are discussing this topic now.
Unfortunately, I so often do not get to visit my grandmothers and girls
if I'm not mistaken, this can lead to ice melting and flooding of some areas
I visit them twice a year, usually in summer and winter
plus, our planet may become deserts and people will start growing fewer plants
but I spend a maximum of two weeks there in one year
In general, this topic is very complex and many experts are working on it.
And yes, I also love to eat there very much))))
What do you suggest? Give an example
It depends on my mood)))
Then, as an economist, I can calculate how much it will cost to develop such a program))))
but I noticed that when you cook for yourself, the food seems tastier
okay, no kidding, I can calculate the damage that will occur due to global warming
maybe it's because you spend effort on it and then get rewarded for it
after that I can suggest ways to minimize costs and save resources
Or am I just imagining it myself?
these measures, in turn, will help raise money to solve this problem.
I think this is how it works in many delashes, but with regards to cooking, I can sometimes make masterpieces
if thoughts are backed up with hard work, then they will definitely become material))))
I love baked chicken with potatoes and garlic
I believe that work is a sheet of paper, and the idea is a pen or pencil
I also like different papsta and cereals, rice is the best and healthiest of this
who needs a pen without paper or paper without a pen?
yes, I noticed that it is easier to cook healthy food than unhealthy food
so here the idea must be together with hard work
even if we compare chicken, it's easier to cook than to fry
lucky you))) I love chips and soda but sometimes I eat healthy food
vegetables and fruits do not need to be cooked at all, washed, cut and you can eat
I like to eat rice and various cereals
this is another reason why I like them so much)))
I eat vegetables and fruits sometimes but not very often)))
You correctly noted that sleep is very important for our life, I recently began to study this
I live in a house but I don't grow vegetables and fruits)))
If you want to improve your sleep, then you should breathe fresh air, drink clean water and eat right.
we could change and I would eat chips in your apartment, and you vegetables and fruits in my house))))
There were a lot of different tips, I can tell you if you're interested))))
you need to go to the village to my grandparents)))
You can always ask me for help and I will help you
they have a very large garden there and a lot of berries and other fruits
the first tip is not to use the phone or computer an hour before bedtime
I like to spend time with them and like to eat healthy food there
the second tip is to sleep in a cool room and it is advisable to open windows
I hope you visit them often
I also read that if you are cold, you can wear warm socks to keep warm
I try to visit my grandparents every month to visit them
I can continue if you are not tired of my advice)))
they are very happy when I visit them
practice is very good, then I will continue
and they feed me very tasty when I visit them))))
thirdly, stressful situations should be avoided a couple of hours before bedtime
As I see it, you and I both love to eat deliciously))))
fourthly, it is desirable to make yourself the right mode so that the body produces the necessary hormones at a certain time
but do you like to cook for yourself or not?
and the last 4-6 hours before bedtime it is better not to drink tea or coffee
I just don't like to cook my own food, only if it's something simple
Many people think that coffee invigorates, but not so long ago it was proved that tea also promotes energy and can interfere with good sleep.
boil eggs or fry potatoes))))
and I found out about it not so long ago
no, I also noticed that when you do something for yourself, the result is better
before that, I always drank tea before going to bed and suffered
there is even some kind of law that proves this
but when I found out about it, I donÂt drink tea 4 hours before bedtime
or you just get your reward for hard work like you said
Now I sleep like a baby, following the rest of the tips
Yes, it's not just that people in China like to eat rice)))
but it may also be due to the fact that I get very tired
and after that they show excellent sports results, apparently it is really useful
Many people like to count their sleep and I do too))))
but for me the most important thing is that it is very easy to prepare
but I noticed that it distracts from the process of sleep
water boils, put rice and waited 20-30 minutes)))
but if you count something consistently in your mind, it helps sleep
By the way, I noticed that nutrition has a very strong effect on sleep.
Breathing exercises and yoga also help a lot.
I used to be unable to fall asleep for a long time, but when I began to drink less coffee and eat less fried foods, I began to fall asleep better
but this is already the highest level))))
and IÂll even say more, my sleep process has also improved, I began to wake up less
ItÂs just that sheÂs probably been doing this for a long time and performs complex elements.
of course I'm interested
to start, just sit and breathe correctly
I noticed that I am very dependent on good sleep and therefore I will gladly listen to your advice
but over time, you can begin to perform complex movements
if you don't mind sharing them, of course.
the main thing is to stretch your muscles and not to rush too much
of course, keep going, I will try to put them into practice today
what kind of injury did you have?
I also thought that only coffee invigorates about tea did not even hear))))
What sport did you do?
Yes, when I'm tired, I sleep like a baby too.
I thought you weren't a sports fan
but if the day turned out to be average, then I can fall asleep for 2-3 hours
oh well done, the gym is good
I just lie and look at the ceiling and count how much sleep I have left)))))
I would like to start too, but for now I'm somehow shy
my girlfriend loves yoga
I'm just thin and I think that I will lift very little weight
she offered me several times to try with her
it is very hard to do something for a long time, many people quit doing it afterwards
but when I saw that it was so difficult, I changed my mind))))
so you need to diversify your life and do different things
Yes, warm-up is very important.
so you don't have to worry about something
I didnÂt pay attention to this before training until I got injured
tired, switched his attention to something else, then interest will return)))))
Shoulder sprain
oh bro, that's commendable
treated it for six months or more
sport helps not only your body but also your mind
at the moment you can say
I myself, if I canÂt think actively, then I go in for some kind of sports and then my brain starts to work better
but I used to go to the gym often
By the way, about my fear of going to the gym, do you have any fears?))
and even I made a training program for myself))))
I'm afraid of a little loneliness and that close people will not understand me
I was also worried at first and did not want to do it, but then everything changed
plus I'm a little afraid of not realizing my dreams, I would like to achieve some success
I realized that there is nothing to be ashamed of and there are a lot of thin guys
I would like to move to another city or another country
in 2 years I gained 10 kg of muscle and already felt more confident in training
I would like to earn enough for me and my family
but then there was little time and it became too lazy to do it and I quit it
I would also like to move with my loved ones
maybe this was my mistake, I did the same exercises strictly according to the program and I got tired of it
I would like to move to America or Europe more, but Asia is also an interesting region
if I diversified my workouts, I might not quit playing sports
especially they are now famous for their fast-growing economy, just related to your profession)))
I'm thinking about going back to the gym soon.
yes, traveling is cool, that's why I chose programming
Yes, physical activity fires up your neurons.
you can work even if you are on a desert island))))
and a lot of athletes are very smart people
Why is this?
I have many fears, I can only list a few of them.
given how the modern world is developing, this may become a reality in the near future
I'm afraid of sharks, especially when I'm sailing far from the shore
people can already fly into Earth's orbit
I also dislike snakes and some insects, for some reason I consider them dangerous
I think many people would like to know the answer to this question
still a little afraid of heights, but this is not such a big fear
but I somehow feel calmer when only people live on this planet)))
what about you, maybe you're still afraid of something?
I think life must exist somewhere else in space
and what are your dreams?
it canÂt be that only in one place life originated and thatÂs all
you have good goals, you can immediately see what you think about your family
you are right bro
I would also like a change of scenery, but I'm not so sure about any other country
I didn't think about it, but it's an interesting idea.
already used to living at home, but it is also interesting to study the mentality of other countries
it probably costs a fortune to get you into space
I like Asian countries and their culture
you must also be in good health because the body is subjected to great stress
Yes, this region is developing very quickly, that's why I'm interested in it.
it is desirable to always be healthy)))) even if you do not want to conquer space
but it is best to visit many countries and explore them
in fact, health and time are the most limited resources in the world
If I do this, I will be able to understand where it is better for me to live
what money can't buy and can't be returned if spent in vain
I understand that for this I need to work hard and work so that I can travel
That's why my parents always taught me to lead a healthy lifestyle and have a good time
I would also like to fly into space or to another planet)))
I can't completely agree with you on this answer.
but I understand that this is already something fantastic
you can have fun with your family and friends
yes, but given my fear of heights, this is a strange dream
And you don't have to have a lot of money to travel.
I'm just wondering what's out there in space and how our poaneta looks from there
but sometimes you really need money
I also wonder if we are alone in this world or there are other creatures
then I misunderstood you bro, sorry
We are lucky to be born on this planet and take part in such a cool project))))
yes, truth is always made in a dispute
Wouldn't you like to fly into space or to another planet?
Speaking of money, what would you spend a million dollars on if you were given it right now?
yes, astronauts are usually very strong people
Of course it's not easy, imagine if I said a billion)))))
they go through a series of tests and do a lot of exercise before going into space
now give me time to think
this is just another argument for me to return to training in the gym))))
in fact, you donÂt need to give me time, I already know where to spend it
if you want to conquer space you have to be healthy
I would like to open my own business and I would like it to be related to technology
yes, if you could buy it, life would be easier
but it's very difficult, I just want money to make even more money)))))
but now money is still important
contact bro, what kind of savings would you send this money to?
if you want to travel you need money
that's right bro, it's better to put some of the money in a safe place and send the other part to promising projects
if you want to have fun sometimes you need money too
I would send part of the money for this project so that it starts to develop even faster
yes, I also think that sometimes money is important, I never said that it is always important
I see great potential in this and I believe that many will support me
no, it's good that we found out the truth)))
it is not necessary to have a large amount of money to start investing
let me think, it's not easy to spend a million dollars at once
it is better to start with small amounts and gain useful experience
thought, first of all I would buy myself a big house
and after that, move on to larger amounts, if you have learned to invest, of course)))))
after that I would have bought a good car, a sports car
that's pretty cool too bro
and with the rest of the money I would go on a trip
we are lucky that now a lot of knowledge can be obtained for free on the Internet
Where would you spend a million dollars?
take and use, no need to pay for knowledge as before
I somehow didn't think about it...
what disadvantage?
But you're right, I'll spend all the money and then what?
we are lucky that we can study at university
you have to pay taxes on the house and on the car too
but just imagine how many people can't afford it?
so I would divide this amount and send half to savings
that's why the internet makes us more similar to each other
thanks for suggesting, now if someone gives me a million dollars, then I'm ready for it)))))
if you do not have money for education, then you can get it yourself
I think I would put some of the money in the bank, the rest I would try to invest in crypto
the main thing is perseverance and faith in one's own strengths
I would also invest in this project
oh how I understand you bro, how I understand you
now many young guys are investing their savings in crypto
I canÂt and donÂt want to stop talking here))))
All that's left is to accumulate your own savings))))))
I remember because I finished school not so long ago
yes i would like to try it soon
Oh, I remember how much nerves I spent preparing for exams)))
here's what I remembered where I would send some money
sitting all night learning something
I would invest in myself to get some new and useful skills
I thought it would end at the university, but there are even more exams at the university
I would spend some money on my education
It seems to me that students are people for whom sleep is a luxury))))
yes, there is a lot of knowledge on the Internet, but there is one drawback
I'm serious, you should study at the university, build your personal life and still work
there is a lot of information on the Internet but it does not have a consistent structure
I think that many people think that their best years will come next
when I use the Internet and want to learn something new, I often see a mess
but at the same time they forget to live in the present
another thing is when information is structured and presented in stages
if you think carefully, the best years of life are now, no matter how old you are
For me, this is the main plus of the university.
you need to enjoy the present and sometimes think about the future)))))
it is, bro
it can even be called a little depression
I wish it was time for me to go to bed and start applying tips for good sleep.
many people in the modern world are worried about their future, there is uncertainty in the future
but I can't stop talking in this chat
so meditation and yoga will help you))))
There are so many things I want to discuss that I don't have time to look at my watch.
when you are alone with your thoughts, you should be relaxed
By the way, do any of you guys remember the time when you were in school?
because if you are often nervous, you can get sick
ahahaha yeah i remember my exam preparation too
this is how our body works
there was a lot to learn, read and write
a sense of anxiety lets you know that something is wrong, and if something is wrong, then something needs to be changed
but when I passed these exams, I felt so good
confidence is very important right now
exams at the university have already become something familiar
This is how natural selection works, the strongest wins.
yes, it's a difficult but at the same time an interesting period in life))))
very interesting topic of the human psyche
I have a lot of funny memories from school and university
if you study it well, you can achieve great success
and i found a lot of friends in these places
now the ability to communicate with other people is a very good skill
you are right, I often think about the future and worry about it
I can't tell who exactly is my best friend, I have many friends
I can say that I do not have time to live in the present and I do not like it (((((
but they have a lot in common so I can describe them all at once
yes, anxiety is a big problem in today's world
they are sociable and cheerful guys with whom it is never boring, they are very hardworking and oral
I noticed that many of my friends are worried about their future
Hahahaha, I think not, but I know why it happened
but some of them are working for a good future, and some are just worried
it's just that in this community there are a lot of people with similar interests, so our friends are somewhat similar to each other
For me, anxiety is a call to action.
wondering what was their first job?
yes, the laws of nature have not been canceled
tell me about some of those moments.
no matter how humanity develops, they will always act
oh how I understand you bro, how I understand you
that is why such projects are created))))
my first job was a taxi driver and I also often confused addresses
this is not only something modern, but also a way to make new friends and become part of something grand
how many interesting cases
talking about friends. Guys, how would you describe your best friend?
I remember how one passenger left my wallet with five thousand dollars in it.
Did you happen to describe my best friend just now?)))))))
he ran after my car for 10 minutes before I noticed him)))))
Oh, I remember my first job very well.
working with people is a very interesting thing
I worked as a pizza delivery man and had to travel all over the city
when you forget five thousand dollars, then you run through 5 hours)))
How many funny moments were there?
yes, you had a nervous job))))
I remember they made a very large order, 6 pizzas for which they had to pay a lot of money
in fact, at any job there can be a lot of interesting cases
I drove there for about one hour and when I arrived, they told me that they didnÂt order anything
so the first job is always fun
oh, how angry I was at that moment, it turns out I mixed up one letter in the name of the street and went to the opposite end of the city
yes, this project attracts attention to itself and you definitely wonÂt get bored with it
according to itgu, instead of good money, I received a reprimand))))))
I came across projects in which it was very boring and almost no one communicated with each other
ahaha, did he really run for 10 minutes? This is very long
but there are a lot of cheerful and sociable people in this project))))
hahahahahaha yes it is
I can draw a little, but I wonÂt say that IÂm directly talented. All projects appreciate your creativity
I also remember I had an interesting case when I decided to eat a little along the way and stopped at a cafe. My order was stolen, which I was supposed to deliver
if you can't draw but you are a sociable and cheerful guy, then you will definitely be noticed
I was already near the destination and this happened, I was very upset and was waiting for a new reprimand
I know some people get NFT tattoos for these projects
15 minutes later they called me and thanked me for the fast delivery and delicious pizza
yes, it just depends on your attitude to tattoos
it turns out that the customer took his pizza while I was waiting for my order and didnÂt tell me anything)))))))))
I don't really like tattoos and I'm unlikely to get a tattoo in the future
yes, when you do something for the first time it's always interesting
For some, a tattoo is something ordinary.
I remember my first NFT project, how interesting and fun it was
you just need to understand that we are all different and everyone has their own principles in life)))))
but what is most surprising in this project is also very interesting and fun for me, although it is not the first for me
yes, someone likes to relax in clubs, someone at home
Guys, which one of you can draw?
someone likes to play computer games, and someone likes to play football
I know that if you can draw then you can make art
but I'm more for playing football)))
Are you serious, some people get NFT tattoos?
you see we have some differences but we could all find common themes
I wouldn't get myself a tattoo either, because it's for life
and what is this topic?
I'd rather do something creative
you are absolutely right in this, this project unites us all
I understand it bro))
whether you like tattoos or relaxing playing football, we are all here for good communication and development of this project
